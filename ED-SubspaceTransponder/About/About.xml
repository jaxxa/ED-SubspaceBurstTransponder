Ideally Bugs should be logged on GitHub although in the discussion thread is also fine.

Contacts Ships or Caravans at a distance and guides them to your colony, allowing you to trade with them.

First the "Subspace Burst Transponder" Must be built, it will then enter a charging mode. Once it is fully charged you can press the Call Button to have it Enter Transmittion Mode. After transition has been completed a Trader will arrive and the device will enter charge mode again.

There are two modes, one for contacting ships and the other for contacting ground caravans. 
Only one device can be transmitting at any one time on each mode. 
Transmission is twice as fast and charging, for the highest number of traders you can have one device transmitting while two are charging for each mode.
