Ideally Bugs should be logged on GitHub although in the discussion thread is also fine.

Allows creation of a Device for contacting passing ships at a distance and guiding them to your colony.

First it must be charged, after the charging has been completed you can set it to entre a transition mode. After transition has been completed a trade ship will arrive in orbit, and the device will enter charge mode again.
Only one device can be transmitting at any one time.
